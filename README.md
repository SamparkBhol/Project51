This project is inspired by the research paper:  
# **["Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496)** by *Luyu Gao, Xueguang Ma, Jimmy Lin, Jamie Callan*.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository explores and implements **Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)** — a novel technique for **zero-shot dense retrieval** in NLP. Unlike traditional retrieval systems that depend on vast amounts of labeled data, **HyDE enables high-accuracy search and question answering with no relevance labels.**

---

## 🚀 Key Idea: Hypothetical Document Embeddings

🔹 **HyDE** leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate a *hypothetical document* from the user's query.  
🔹 This generated document reflects an ideal answer or context relevant to the query — even though it doesn't actually exist in the corpus.  
🔹 The system then encodes this hypothetical document into an **embedding**, and uses it to retrieve **real documents** from a target corpus using vector similarity search.

## ✨ Why HyDE?

- ✅ Eliminates the need for labeled training data (zero-shot)
- ✅ Uses LLMs to bridge the query-document gap
- ✅ Greatly improves dense retrieval performance
- ✅ Ideal for:
  - Search Engines
  - Chatbots
  - Question-Answering Systems
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
